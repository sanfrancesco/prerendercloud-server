# 1. NOTE: this file was auto-generated by the flyctl CLI's `flyctl launch` command
# 2. there are only 3 required fields to set: the "app", "internal_port", and "PRERENDER_TOKEN" fields

# OPTIONAL:
# 1. optionally set CANONICAL_HOST to your actual domain name e.g. www.example.com, then if you have apex example.com also pointed here, it will redirect to www.example.com
# 2. optionally set CRAWL_HOST to your actual domain name e.g. www.example.com, use with `--crawl-whitelist-on-boot` (see readme)
# 3. set DISABLE_PRERENDERING_FOR_SECONDS to "40" to give fly.io deploys enough time to finish before pre-rendering (to avoid pre-rendering the old version)
